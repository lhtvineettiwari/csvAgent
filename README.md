# CSV Question & Answer Agent

This project provides a Streamlit-based agent that allows users to upload a CSV file and ask questions about the data using natural language. The agent converts these questions into MongoDB queries, executes them, and displays the results.

The CSV Agent works on the ReACT framework method in which agent think, plan and execute. This is how the Agent thinking process looks like.
```
ü§î Understanding the question: how many total users are from Nepal

üîÑ Sending to LLM with available fields: Index, Customer Id, First Name, Last Name, Company, City, Country, Phone 1, Phone 2, Email, Subscription Date, Website

üß† LLM's Thinking Process:

1. The user is looking for the total number of users from Nepal.
2. The field that contains the country information is "Country".
3. We can count the number of users from Nepal by matching the "Country" field with the value "Nepal".
4. We will use the count operation to get the total count of users from Nepal.

üìù Generated Query: {"filter": {"Country": {regex":"Nepal","options": "i"}}, "operation": "count"}

‚úÖ Query validation: Valid JSON
```

## Features

*   **CSV Upload:** Upload CSV files directly through the Streamlit interface.
*   **Data Preview:** Preview the first few rows of the uploaded CSV data.
*   **MongoDB Integration:** Loads the CSV data into a MongoDB database for querying.
*   **Natural Language Queries:** Ask questions about the data using natural language.
*   **Query Processing:** Converts natural language questions into MongoDB queries using a language model.
*   **Results Display:** Displays the results of the executed queries in a user-friendly format.

## Dependencies

*   streamlit
*   pandas
*   pymongo
*   langchain\_openai
*   langchain\_core

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas pymongo langchain_openai langchain_core
    ```

2.  **Install MongoDB:**

    Ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally. You can download it from the official MongoDB website.

3.  **Environment Configuration:**

    Make sure you have an OPENAI API key set as an environment variable.

## Setup Instructions using UV

1.  **Install UV:**

    Install `uv` from [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

2.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lhtvineettiwari/csvAgent.git
    cd csvAgent
    ```

3.  **Sync Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Run the Streamlit App:**

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2.  **Upload CSV File:**

    Use the file uploader in the app to upload your CSV file.

3.  **Ask Questions:**

    Enter your questions in the text input field and press Enter. The agent will process your question and display the results.

## Example Questions

*   "What are the names of all customers in California?"
*   "What is the average age of the users?"

## Code Process Explanation

1.  The Streamlit app starts by allowing the user to upload a CSV file.
2.  Once the file is uploaded, the data is read using Pandas and displayed in a preview.
3.  The data is then loaded into a MongoDB database running locally.
4.  The app initializes a QueryAgent with the available fields from the CSV.
5.  The user can then ask questions about the data in natural language.
6.  The QueryAgent converts the natural language question into a MongoDB query using a language model.
7.  The query is executed against the MongoDB database, and the results are displayed.

## MongoDB Cloud Configuration

To use MongoDB Cloud instead of a local instance:

1.  Replace the local MongoDB connection string (`mongodb://localhost:27017`) in `app.py` with your MongoDB Cloud connection string.
2.  Ensure your MongoDB Cloud cluster is properly configured with the necessary permissions.

## OpenAI API Key Configuration

The OpenAI API key should be set as an environment variable named `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The format is a string of characters. For example:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Notes

*   Ensure MongoDB is running on the default port (27017) or configure the connection string accordingly.
*   The agent uses the "csvAgent" database and the "csv\_data" collection.
*   The OpenAI API key must be set as an environment variable.
